# Welcome to Nich Feingolds Website!

The main featuring of this webpage is that the content primarily composed in *Markdown*, rather than traditional formatting languages.

*Please look below to find my resume*

Here is some exmaples of Markdown:


### Undorered Lists 
- A short list
    - And an indented item
    - And another!
- But not too many

### Ordered Lists
1. A cat
    1. Not a dog
2. More cats
    1. But this time it is a dog
